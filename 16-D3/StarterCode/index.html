          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between  Age, Income, Poverty Level Rate & Health Risks</h2>
          <p>Observation 1: Percentage of Population in Poverty.   In general, health concerns tend to increase 
            with increasing poverty percentage within a US state.  Additionally, there tends to be higher poverty 
            in Southeastern States, along with higher incidences of all three comparisons provided.</p>

          <p>Observation 2: Median Age.  Rather than an US trend, age comparisons by particular US States seem to be more insightful. 
            For example, WV has a higher age median, better healthcare, but higher percentages of obesity ad smokers.  
            Likewise, Northeastern States tend to have a higher age median and better healthcare.</p>

          <p>Observation 3: Median Household Income. There appears to be a link between household income and the occurrence 
            of obesity and smoking: The higher the income the less likelihood the two idicators occur together. Comparing 
            Household Income vs a Lack of Healthcare, reveals a strong link between health risks and those with lesser incomes. Further,  
            Southeastern States seem to rank lower compared to Northeastern states. Interestingly, TX and MA seem to have a high percentage lacking healthcare, 
            while the extreme opposite is true for MA.</p>
